# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
I will attempt to teach myself data structures and algorithms using c and a bit of Makefile
# Contents 
This subject is content heavy and I will divide it into the following sections:
1.  Recursion
2.  Analysis of algorithms
3.  Abstract data types
4.  Binary search trees
5.  Balanced search trees
6.  Graphs
7.  Sorting algorithms
8.  Heaps
9.  Hashing
10. Tries
11. Performance Analysis 
# Aim 
To think like a computer scientist and solve problems as efficiently as possible!
