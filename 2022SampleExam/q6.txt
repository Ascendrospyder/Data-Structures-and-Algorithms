Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.
The avl tree is the most suitable data type. An AVL tree is a binary search tree that 
rebalances itself automatically. The AVL tree is a suitable data structure to implement 
this PQ adt as to add a new element takes O(log(n)). To pop the key with the highest priority would 
take O(nlog(n)) time as it takes n time to search an avl tree and it takes log(n) time to delete that element. 
Moreover, it takes
