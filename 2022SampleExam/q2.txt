Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.
The following error occurs as a result of either one of two cases. One, where the struct isnt declared at all, or two when it isn't defined. 
In our case the following struct graph has been defined as Graph g does not fail, therefore this leads us to believe that edges hasn't been defined 
yet which in turn results in the following error.
