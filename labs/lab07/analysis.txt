NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

- Worst case time complexity: O(V + E) where V = vertices and E = Edges 

- Explanation: Since we have to initialise the bool and pred matrices it takes V time. 
  Moreover, the program will go through all of the Edges of the maze until the queue 
  is empty, hence resulting in E time. As such it will have O(V + E)  time complexity. 

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V + E)

- Explanation: Since we have to initialise the bool and pred matrices it takes V time. 
  Moreover, the program will go through all of the Edges of the maze as a result of the 
  for loop and will do so for E - 1 times, hence resulting in E time. As such
  it will have O(V + E)  time complexity.
