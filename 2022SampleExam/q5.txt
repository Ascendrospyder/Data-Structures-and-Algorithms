Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the steps you would take to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.
    To determine if the which sorting algorithm is which we will first need to test for the stability. 
    Since selection sort and randomised quicksort are not stable algorithms we will now need to test for 
    the runtime of the program by either creating a shell script or running the .time linux command. We will first 
    


(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.
