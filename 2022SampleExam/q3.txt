Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.
    The following tree traversed in post order would result in B. This being as given, the 
    preorder which printf the root, then the left and right subtree, we can make a sketch of the 
    tree of interest. As a result, since post order traversal is left then right subtree and finally 
    the root, we result in the combination of 2 8 7 14 10 20 33 40 24 16


(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root):  32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39 

(c)

i.  Value(s) in the root node: 20 

ii. Value(s) in the node that now contains 62: 35 60 62
