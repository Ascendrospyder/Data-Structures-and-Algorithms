Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.
We can use kruskals to derive the minimum spanning tree below. Kruskals algorithm, relies 
on the fact that we choose edges with the minimum weight and check to see if that forms a cycle. If it doe
not then we add that edge to our tree. The reason why this would use kruskals algorithm instead of prims is because 
prims algorithm relies on the edges to be connected at all times. Furthermore, we can use dfs to build the folowing minimum
spanning tree.
