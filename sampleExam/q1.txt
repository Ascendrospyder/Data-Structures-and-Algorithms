Question 1

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.
The following algorithm has a time complexity of O(nlog(n)). This being as a result of breaking the problem into a 
size of n/2 in turn takes log(n) time to complexity. Then, it is known to take O(n) time to combine the results of the 
subproblems which in turn means it takes O(nlog(n)) time.
