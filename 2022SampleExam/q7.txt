Question 7

(a) How many items are examined in searching for the key 42? Justify
    your answer.
    It will be examined 4 times. This being as 42 % 11 = 9 which means it will get 
    placed in the 9th index so we need to check there, at the 9th index we have 9, 20, 31 and 42 inserted (up to and including 42).
    As a result we would only check 4 item.


(b) How many items are examined in searching for the key 111? Justify
    your answer.
    It would be examined 9 times. This being as 111 % 11 results in 0, where in the 0th index
    the following numbers are inserted. 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Since 111 is not inserted it 
    will only make 9 checks. 


(c) What is the worst-case search cost after N total items have been
    inserted? Justify your answer.
    The following would take O(N/11) time.
